# wordle-guesser

Tool that can guess wordle word based on your input and the given results.
It uses a terminal-based GUI to set wordsize, guess count and to input your results.
It can currently only show the possible solutions based on your inputs. The functionality to calculate the best next guess still needs to be made. W.I.P.

Currently using outdated conio.h library. Need to update.

Text files "guesses.txt" and "solutions.txt" can be used when prompted. You can also use your own, make sure they contain 1 word per line and are all the same length.
